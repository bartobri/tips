Tips
====

If you've found any of my open source projects helpful to the extent that
you'd like to repay me in some way, I've created this tips page just for
you! Below are a couple methods you can use to tip me for my work.
I work on open source software full time, and I do not get paid for it.
Any tips are greatly appreciated.
