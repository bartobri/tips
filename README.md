Tips
====

If you've found any of my open source projects helpful to the extent that
you'd like to repay me in some way, I've created this tips page just for
you! Below are various methods you can show your appreciate for my work.
I work on open source software full time, and I do not get paid for it.
I do it out of love. So any tips are greatly appreciated.
